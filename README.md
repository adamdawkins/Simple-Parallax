Simple-Parallax
===============

Incredibly simple to use parallax using css only. Take advantage of the browser's native ability to fix background positions using "background-attachment:fixed;".

Could easily be improved using some javascript to alter the background position as the user scrolls, but I wanted to keep it simple for now.

Love to hear your thoughts and ideas!
